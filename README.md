To all business owners, my name is Seo Dongmin, currently an undergraduate student majoring in Informatics here at Indiana University.
Results from the survey I’ve conducted shows that 92 people out of 100 people could not visualise how food would look and taste like.

Hence, customers usually resort to only ordering the few popular items from the menu, while largely ignoring the many other dishes offered.
To resolve such a selection bias, I have developed 'BtownTip'.

BtownTip is a web/mobile friendly advertising platform that seeks to advertise to local businesses in Bloomington as well as to promote these businesses’ customer interests.

For business owners, BTownTip start with an annual fee of 100 dollars to advertise each owners' unique selling points to the customers in Bloomington.

BtownTip's biggest advantage is having the ability to match restaurants' menus with pictures of dishes.
Having images provided to customers allows customers to easily grasp an idea of the dish and gain an accurate expectation from the menu, which can, in turn, greatly promote the chances of customers trying out different dishes.

Additionally, BtownTip is designed to be 'one click' friendly that quickly and easily allow customers to visit the respective sites of restaurants.
For example, the site will show the menu, opening hours, and contact information of the selected restaurant, organised to be viewed all in one glance.

Moreover, BtownTip is equipped with a visitor count to calculate the effectiveness of the site.
Therefore, once you have made a contract with BtownTip, you will experience a better advertisement impact. BtownTip just started it, however, I strongly believe that as time passes, BTownTip will be able to cover every corner of Bloomington.
If interested, please call 610-674-5114 or email via btownadsagency@gmail.com.
I look forward to working with your business.

Sincerely,
Dongmin Seo
